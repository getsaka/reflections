How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see 
the bug that was introduced?
By comparing the two files and showing the differences on screen.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file 
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
By noticing the mistakes I did and what I did wrong I will learn
not to do the same mistakes again on other projects.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a 
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pro: I save what in my opinion is an important change
Con: It's easy to forget saving and end up with a too big commit

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I can change them back easily.
